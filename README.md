# Twitch-Channel-Point-Extension

This code is pretty specific to my channel point rewards but this can get you started on getting the extension in your browser and running on your stream manager.

I have removed my URL information from the files.

Update the manifest file to contain your twitch stream manager URL. This makes it run on that page only. Update the javascript as needed (reward name, URL, etc).

Put the manifest file and the javascript file into a folder. Create 3 image icons with the names: icon32.png, icon64.png, and icon128.png within that folder as well.
In Chrome go to the manage extensions page and enable *developer mode*. Choose *load unpacked* and select the folder with the files above.
